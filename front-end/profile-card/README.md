# From Front-end Mentor // Profile card component

Your challenge is to build out this profile card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Getting started
Download the starter code

Set up the project with version control (e.g. Git)

Read the README.md file and have a look around the project

Get colors, fonts etc from the style-guide.md file

Set up your project/file architecture however you want

Start coding!

This is a perfect challenge to test your layout skills. 
The card layout doesn't shift, so it's also great for those that haven't dived into responsive websites yet!
