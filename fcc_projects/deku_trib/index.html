      <p>Even though Izuku was born <strong>Quirkless</strong>, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero <strong>All Might</strong> due to his innate heroism and strong sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil, as well as a student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him the ninth holder of <strong>One For All</strong>.</p>
